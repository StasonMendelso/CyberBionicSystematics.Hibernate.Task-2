# CyberBionicSystematics.Hibernate.Task-2

## What is the project about?

Repository is for educational purpose - doing a [home-task №2](JDBC & Hibernate_ Домашнее задание 2.pdf) on
the [course][1]. I am enrolled in the [course][1] about Hibernate framework, where the topic of [JDBC][3] is attached.
So, my second task is about connection to the database using only the JDBC and write the implementation of next DAO
class. The last point of task is write the console app for practice.

## What is the purpose of this project?

The **purpose** of the project is ***practicing basics*** about the connection to the database using only JDBC,
how it should be used correctly to get the *most benefits*.

## Getting Started

As there isn't a real or PET project, it's project about doing the homework from course. So, you need
download the code from the **main** branch for showing the completed task. For this, see the sections below.

### Prerequisites

For running the project you need the next:

* [MySQL Community Server 8.0.31](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/) - for running the app with database.
  You can find the [script](databaseApp/database/carShop_db.sql) of creating database in directory with name "*[database](databaseApp/database)*".

### Installation Instruction

#### How to download project on my local machine?

For downloading the project locally you can use two variants:

1. Download the ZIP archive from the repository page.

   The method is easy, the next steps helps you:
1. Find the button `Code` and press it.
2. Find the button `Download ZIP` and press it. The downloading must start.
3. Unzip the archive in soe directory and run the IDEA in this directory.

Project has been installed. After opening it in your IDEA, the `Maven` downloads
some additional dependencies.

1. Use the `Git` for downloading the repository locally.

   The method a lit bit difficult, but the project will be downloaded with the help
   of several commands, and not manually, as in the previous method. For this method
   you **need** to [install][4] the `Git Bash` on your computer, make some configuration and have a primary skill of
   using this system of version control.
2. Enter your [name][5], [email][6] of GitHub account locally on your machine.
3. Create an empty directory and initialize it as git repository. Use the next
   command - `git init`.
4. Adds this repository to yours with name `origin` (you can change it, if you want):
    ```
   $ git remote add origin git@github.com:StasonMendelso/CyberBionicSystematics.Hibernate.Task-2.git
   ```
   But you need configure your SSH connection to your GitHub profile in Git Bash. See more [here][7].

   For viewing that the repository has been added successfully to your local
   repository, you need execute the next command and get the following result:
   ```
   $ git remote -v
   ```
   ![git remote repository](images/img.png)

   After this step your local repository has got a 'connection' to the remote
   project from the GitHub repository.
5. For downloading the project use the following command:
   ```
   $ git pull origin main
   ```
   After these steps your project directory must contain the project files from
   GitHub repository. In addition to, you can create a new branch, make some
   changes and create a pull request for suggesting your improvements. Also, all
   changes are observed by the `git` and you can always make a rollback of
   all changes `git reset --hard`.

#### What things you need to install the software and how to install them

##### Database configuration

For running the database you can use as me MySQL Server or create your own database on another SQL server(**not
recommended**) using the [script](databaseApp/database/carShop_db.sql) file of creating the database.

**Note**: if you use another server not such MySQL
you should change JDBC driver for working with it and configurate the connection to your server in
properly [java database configuration class](databaseApp/src/main/java/simple_dao/dao/AbstractJdbcDao.java) by changing configuration of
connection. For changing the JDBC driver you should change the dependency
in the [pom.xml file](pom.xml) and the name of the driver in the configuration class.
